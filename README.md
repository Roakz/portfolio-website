I have just completed the wireframes for the index page and the Mobile layout as you can see below. Its time to complete the layouts for the ipad and desktop versions and then on to some coding !! I am completing this project with the Mobile first methodology which is meant to improve responsiveness. Ill use some grid and flex box which i have seen in action and was impressed by the results. Both for ease of development and also for responsiveness. I have tried to make a very visual design with animation but still with accessability in mind. Ill keep you posted!!<br><br>
