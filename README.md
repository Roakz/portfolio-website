<h1>Welcome to my Portfolio Website</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

Hey! This is my portfolio website!! This website was created to form part of a Diploma of Information Technology, web development stream, which im completing at Coder Academy Brisbane. I have used HTML5, Css3 (with SCSS) & it has been hosted here at GitHub Pages. The address for the site is https://roakz.github.io/portfolio-website/ <br><br>

I will use this website to upload projects that im undertaking and use it as a portfolio for my work. As my skills progress and i continue to learn further frameworks and languages I will endeavour to upgrade it to showcase my skills. It will become a digital resume & hopefully help me secure an Internship or paid Employment as a junior Web Developer.<br><br>

Below I have included a site map, Some screen shots of the site, some information about the features & functionality and some information about some lessons learnt during development.<br><br>

I have just completed the wireframes for the index page and the Mobile layout as you can see below. Its time to complete the layouts for the ipad and desktop versions and then on to some coding !! I am completing this project with the Mobile first methodology which is meant to improve responsiveness. Ill use some grid and flex box which i have seen in action and was impressed by the results. Both for ease of development and also for responsiveness. I have tried to make a very visual design with animation but still with accessability in mind. Ill keep you posted!!<br><br>

Today has been productive. I have managed to complete the mobile version of the index page pretty much to entirity at this stage. All links from this page are active and working. Tonight i will get the media queries done and adjust the layouts for tablet and desktop. It shouldnt take to long its just a slight change in layout of the grid. This site is extremly responsive as is but i think visually will benefit from media queries. Totally visual rather than because its breakable. Tommorrow will be onwards with the layout of the other pages on the site!. Lesson learnt....You cant animate display as it has no measurable parameters and isnt an inbuilt css functions. you can however play with the height and opacity of things to make the animation work in a similar way. I now have an operational dropdown hamburger that is animated !!! woo hoo !.

check out my linkdin for a video of how responsive grid is without any media queries https://www.linkedin.com/in/rory-bell-a18233193/ .
